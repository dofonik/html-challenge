Module 11 Challenge - UWA Data Analytics Bootcamp

This repository contains two files: "Main_Code" and "DataOutput". DataOutput contains a csv file that is created via the scripts in the "Main_Code" file.

The "Main_Code" file contains two ipynb documents. Part 1 scrapes and stores results from https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_news/index.html. Part 2 scrapes, stores and analyses data from https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_facts/temperature.html.

The following questions were answered using the "part_2_mars_weather.ipynb" file in "Main_Code":

1. How many months exist on Mars?
From the dataset, 12 months exist for Mars.

2. How many Martian (and not Earth) days worth of data exist in the scraped dataset?
There are 1867 Martian days worth of data in this dataset.

3. What are the coldest and the warmest months on Mars (at the location of Curiosity)? To answer this question:
Martian month 8 is the warmest month with an average temperature of -68.38 degrees C, whilst Martian month 3 was the coldest with an average temperature of -83.31.

4. Which months have the lowest and the highest atmospheric pressure on Mars? To answer this question:
Martian month 6 has the lowest average atmospheric pressure (745.05 mmHg), Martian month 9 has the highest average atmospheric pressure (913.31 mmHg).

5. About how many terrestrial (Earth) days exist in a Martian year? To answer this question:
The distance from one peak to the next appears to be just under 2 Earth years. Roughly 700 Earth days. The real number of Earth days in a Martian year is 687 days.
